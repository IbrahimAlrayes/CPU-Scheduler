# CPU-Scheduler
Operation System CPU Scheduler by implementing Round Robin, Shortest Job First and Priority-based algorithms  
# CPU Scheduler
## Overview
This repository features an implementation of a CPU Scheduler employing three distinct algorithms: Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), Round Robin, Non Preemptive Priority and Shortest Job First (SJF). These algorithms play a crucial role in managing the execution of processes within a computer system.

## Features
### Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF): This algorithm selects the process with the smallest remaining burst time for execution, ensuring optimal efficiency.
### Round Robin: A widely used time-sharing algorithm that allocates CPU time in a fixed, cyclic order, promoting fairness among processes.
### Shortest Job First (SJF): This algorithm prioritizes the execution of processes based on their burst times, aiming to minimize overall completion time.
### Non-Preemptive Priority: Processes are executed based on priority, with the highest-priority process being selected first. Preemption is not allowed in this variant.
